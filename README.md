This is a ROUGH DRAFT of the README.  It's just a copy-paste of the project proposal for now:

## User Stories
-As a wine lover, I can find new wines to try by searching or browsing
-AAU, I can create lists/collections of wines and add new wines to them
-AAU, I can follow a link to an external site to purchase a wine to try
-AAU, I can view information about a specific wine
-AAU, I can view & edit my personal/profile information


## MVP Goals (How your specific project will look & behave in order to accomplish MVP)
- Mobile-first design (incl. bottom nav instead of top nav for mobile size)
- Landing page with login/sign up/ about 
- Home page inviting user to browse wines or view/edit their collection
- User can search for wines via Vivino API 
- Profile page where user can view & edit personal/profile information
- Connects to SQL-type database to store user lists & user details
- Have 2 models/schemas: User & List
- Collections/Your Lists page where user can create lists & add wines to a collection


## Stretch Goals (How your specific project look & behave *AFTER* you accomplish MVP)
- Code some views as modals (ex: wine show page)
- Home page shows a carousel of randomly selected wines
- User can share a list/collection, internally (public list) or externally ("send to...")
- User can externally share a wine
- User can add a wine to a list from various points in the app (wine show page, results page, collection show page)


## Anything Else You'd Like Us to Know
I'd like to use this opportunity to fix the UX/UI shortcomings in my original project 2.  I would like to be able to show growth and flexibility in coding.  More specifically, I want to link directly to the Vivino API and make it much more intuitive for users to add wines to their lists.
