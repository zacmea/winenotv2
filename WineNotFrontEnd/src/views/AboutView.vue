    <h1>About the developer</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Zachary Mears spent a decade in K-12 public education before beginning a transition into tech in 2023.  His time in education was defined by a strong understanding of how people learn and process information and how they navigate the world around them.  As a developer, Zachary brings to bear that same understanding, coupled with an innate curiousity about how things are built and how people interact with the products in their everyday lives.</p>
